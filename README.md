## Project compilation
in order to compile as easy as possible, we use platformIO and Visual Studio Code. The platformio.ini contains all the dependencies. Follow the next steps
1. Download Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the PlatformIO extension.
3. Clone the repository.
4. open the folder repository in VS Code.
5. Follow the considerations.
6. Press "platformIO: Build".
7. done.

## Considerations
It is important to modify the next file.

modify the next lines in the HardwareSerial.cpp file (this file is part of the Core of the ESP32)  
`line 10: #define RX1 9 change to #define RX1 26`  
`line 14: #define TX1 10 change to #define TX1 27`
